                  I'm an aspiring web developer with a background in education and biology. I'm interested in responsive web apps that unobtrusively facilitate the logistics of daily life by synthesizing meaningful information for users. My areas of expertise include Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, Backbone.js

              Originally from Davis, I grew up in Florianópolis, Brazil where I enjoyed the adventure of an island upbringing. From an early age I enjoyed disassembling anything with moving parts. Luckily the family’s Macintosh LC II survived my curiosity (the VCR wasn’t as fortunate, sorry mom). My youth was occupied by Judo, Dungeons & Dragons, Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels, basketball all set to a soundtrack by Queen.

              I returned to California for college at UC Davis where I studied Biology with an emphasis in Neurology, Physiology and Behavior. Living at Agrarian Effort, a student housing co-op on campus, was a formative experience for me. It taught me about intentional communities, consensus governance and the importance of proactive and equitable dialog among peers.

              After a brief stint in Neuroscience research at Davis and Santa Cruz, I changed gears and pursued a Masters degree in Education. Being an educator has always a fun endeavor, whether I was teaching community workshops on making worm bins for composting or leading Neurobiology discussion groups as a teaching assistant . After graduating, I remained in Santa Cruz tending to a half-acre educational garden for a bilingual elementary school and teaching science.

              In Santa Cruz things were brewing, figuratively and literally. (We made a mean IPA and dubbed it HopTopic, get it?) Encouraged by friends familiar with technical propensity, I applied to App Academy and moved up to the Bay Area to learn Web Development. The educational experience was like none other, and the confluence of creativity and skill was incredibly stimulating and rewarding. I look forward building, learning and contributing this amazing community.
